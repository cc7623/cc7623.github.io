[Original Reddit post by bag.xml](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegacyJailbreak/comments/194inh4/a_snippet_of_whats_about_to_come_discussion/)\
This completely revives the YT app for iOS 5.1.1 and now you can\
use YT with no bugs, just like it was back in the 2010's.

TUTORIAL:\
UNINSTALL "TUBEFIXER" AND "CLASSIC YT APP" FROM IPG BEFORE STARTING.
1. Download the tweak "TUBEREPAIR [BETA]" from their repo, https://cydia.mali357.gay/. (idk, weird domain name)
2. Download YT 1.1.0. [Link is here](https://github.com/cc7623/cc7623.github.io/raw/main/downloads/YouTube%201.1.0.ipa), hosted on my website. Delete current YT and then sideload 1.1.0.
3. Open settings, find TubeRepair, and select Custom URL. Type in (EXACT! CASE SENSITIVE!) "http://ax.init.mali357.gay/TubeRepair/" As of right now, it's the only public instance of TubeRepair hosted.
4. Next, type in your YT API key in the API KEY section. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4zvduVAqo - How to get an YT API key)
5. Lastly, as request header, type in "X-TubeRepair-API-Key".
6. Respring and launch YT!
