TUBEREPAIR LETS YOU REVIVE OLD YOUTUBE ON IOS 5 & 6!\
TubeRepair by bag.xml has just been released & is now in beta. (as of now, it's only been around for abt a day.)\
[Original Reddit post by bag.xml](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegacyJailbreak/comments/194inh4/a_snippet_of_whats_about_to_come_discussion/)\
This completely revives the YT app for iOS 5.1.1 and now you can\
use YT with no bugs, just like it was back in the 2010's.

***

TUTORIAL:\
UNINSTALL "TUBEFIXER" AND "CLASSIC YT APP" FROM IPG BEFORE STARTING.
1. Download the tweak "TUBEREPAIR [BETA]" from their repo, https://cydia.mali357.gay/.
2. Download YT 1.1.0. [Link is here](https://github.com/cc7623/cc7623.github.io/raw/main/downloads/YouTube%201.1.0.ipa), hosted on my website. Delete current YT and then sideload 1.1.0.
3. Open settings, find TubeRepair, and select Custom URL. Type in (EXACT! CASE SENSITIVE!) "http://ax.init.mali357.gay/TubeRepair/" As of right now, it's the only public instance of TubeRepair hosted.
4. Next, type in your YT API key in the API KEY section. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4zvduVAqo - How to get an YT API key)
5. Lastly, as request header, type in "X-TubeRepair-API-Key".
6. Respring and launch YT!

[Some more ways to run YT](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegacyJailbreak/comments/1ab7uox/discussion_4_ways_to_access_youtube_ios_6/):
1. Classic YouTube App (restore the app, API key, YT fixer)- most vintage, also the slowest method

2. [Invidious](https://docs.invidious.io/instances/)/[Iteroni](https://iteroni.com/feed/popular)/[yt20092](https://yt20092.giabs.ovh/mobile/blzr/#/home) (through Safari)- faster.

3. m.youtube.com (GSignIn tweak from IPG)- allows you to sign in, quite fast

4. m.youtube.com/subscriptions - same as 3 but even faster, though this leads you to a 404 error page, it gives you a YouTube search bar, so no time is wasted loading recommended page.
