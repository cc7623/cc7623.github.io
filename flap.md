2. Update to the latest version of iOS for your device. Make sure it is `6.1.6`, `7.1.2`, `8.4.1`, `9.3.5`/`9.3.6`, or `10.3.4`.

## 64-bit

1. Download [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/#:~:text=Apple%20download%20link-,Download%20Sideloadly)
2. Download [Flappy Bird IPA File](https://github.com/brandonplank/flappybird/releases/tag/4.3)

- Open up `Sideloadly`.
- Connect your device to your computer and trust it in `iTunes` or `Finder`
- Under Apple account type your `apple ID email`
- Make sure you `trusted` your device and it shows up under `iDevice`
- Drag your `IPA file` into the sideloadly window. You can also click on the large IPA icon and select it from your computer.
- Click `Start`
- If you are using an `apple ID` for the first time with sideloadly, it will ask to enter the password and verification code that you will receive on a `trusted device`.
- Your password is encrypted and is only sent to apple, however, I recommend you use a `spare` or `alternate` apple ID.
- Once your password was entered and your account was verified, the IPA will install on your device.
- To launch the app, go to `Settings > General > Profiles and Device Management` for iOS 14 and below. `VPN and Device Management` for iOS 15 and up.
- Select the apple ID you chose to sign the app and click it
- Hit `Trust`
- You can now launch the app from your home screen.
- Enjoy!
