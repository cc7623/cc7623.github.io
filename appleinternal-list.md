#### Get device out of DemoMode

- Go to the admin menu (three fingers in the corner. picture link at the bottom)
- Press unenroll, it will work fine! However, if the store is enrolled in the Demo Device Lock Theft Deterrence Program, you have to use the web app, which you don't have the password to, so you can't unenroll it.  
Here is an image on how to do the admin menu:  
Just put your three fingers in the areas there, and then choose reset.

#### Applications:  

MOST APPS HERE are for AppleConnect, which are used (or were once used) by Apple employees to communicate and use in a business environment. Some apps here are for prototype purposes (*Also goes by InternalUI*) or DemoUnit apps (*installed on demo devices which are displayed in the Apple Store*), but most are for the communication among Apple Employees and are for business. For actual InternalUI apps, check up above for the tutorial "how to install InternalUI firmware".

(`Unknown` versions aren't unknown- there are either too many to look through or I do not have enough time to manually add each 'n' every iOS version.)
