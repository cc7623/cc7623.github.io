*Just a small website with some tutorials and links. Mostly AppleInternal/LegacyJailbreak stuff.*  


***

Includes articles on how to:

- [*Flash InternalUI builds* (untethered, retain data)](https://cc7623.github.io/internaluifirmware.html)
- [*Fix YT app on iOS 4/5/6*](https://cc7623.github.io/tuberepair)
- [*Fix the iOS 4/5/6 appstore*](https://cc7623.github.io/storebroken)
- [*RDP w/ iPad*](https://cc7623.github.io/articles/remotecontrol)
- And more to come in the future!

***

Agenda:
- [ ] tweak recommendations
- [x] more tutorials
- [x] moving all articles to a seperate folder
- [x] rewriting everything in MD since I'm too lazy to learn CSS. *(note- kept index in html since I'm still too lazy to rewrite it)*
