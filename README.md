*Just a small website with some articles and links for LegacyJailbreaking. Mostly AppleInternal/InternalUI stuff.*  


***

Includes articles on how to:

- [*Flash InternalUI builds* (untethered, retain data)](https://cc7623.github.io/internaluifirmware.html)
- [*Flash Weather, Stocks, Phone, Passbook on iPad // PhotoBooth, Facetime on iPhone*](https://cc7623.github.io/unsupportedapps.html) (not finished, still writing it)
- [*Fix YT app on iOS 4/5/6*](https://cc7623.github.io/tuberepair)
- [*Fix the iOS 4/5/6 appstore*](https://cc7623.github.io/storebroken)
- [*RDP w/ iPad*](https://cc7623.github.io/articles/remotecontrol)
- And more to come in the future!

***

Agenda:
- more tutorials,
- some cool tweak recommendations,
- moving all articles to a seperate folder (getting pretty messy already),
- learning CSS, or
- rewriting everything in MD since I'm too lazy for CSS/HTML.
