What? My app store's broken?


This problem affects (AFAIK) iOS 4, 5, and 6.


(from u/MeMeYuGi)\
"iTunes Store seems to be down again on iOS 6.x (And possibly wont even open on the old versions now)\
I just checked my connection to http://ax.init.itunes.apple.com/bag.xml only for me to return a 403. This is the same cause to the "death" of the store from July 9th to approximately september 20th."


How do I fix it?\
Add the repo http://cydia.mali357.gay/. Download the tweak iTunesStoreX and respring.\
WARNING! This will drain your battery a bit faster. Not much, (tested on iPhone 5/iOS6 and iPad 2/iOS6)\
but still be careful if you have a weak battery.



iOS 5 login and downloads fix tweak soon from MeMeYuGi.
