#### Get device out of DemoMode

- Go to the admin menu (three fingers in the corner. picture link at the bottom)
- Press unenroll, it will work fine! However, if the store is enrolled in the Demo Device Lock Theft Deterrence Program, you have to use the web app, which you don't have the password to, so you can't unenroll it.  
Here is an image on how to do the admin menu:  
Just put your three fingers in the areas there, and then choose reset.
