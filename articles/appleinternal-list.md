#### Quick way to distinguish apps:
AppleInternal: all apps for apple (which are not supposed to be released to the public) are grouped under this category.  
AppleConnect: apps which employees use for business, under main catagory AppleInternal.  
InternalUI: apps for prototyping iOS devices, under main catagory AppleInternal.

#### Get device out of DemoMode

- Go to the admin menu (three fingers in the corner. picture link at the bottom)
- Press unenroll, it will work fine! However, if the store is enrolled in the Demo Device Lock Theft Deterrence Program, you have to use the web app, which you don't have the password to, so you can't unenroll it.  
Here is an image on how to do the admin menu:  
Just put your three fingers in the areas there, and then choose reset.

#### Applications:  

##### If there is no iOS/macOS version next to the link, it is unknown.
*MOST APPS HERE are for AppleConnect, which are used (or once used) by Apple employees to communicate and use in a business environment. Some apps here (Like `NetworkCheck`) are for test purposes (test device's functions and if they work properly, also named InternalUI), but most are for the communication among Apple Employees and for business. For actual InternalUI apps, check up above for the tutorial "how to install InternalUI firmware". hope this clears it up!*

- Alright, here's how to get DemoLoop for iOS 16-16.1.2.  First install this profile using [Apple Configurator](https://ia800200.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/31/items/apple-partner-demo-june-2024v-1.mobileprovision_202402/Apple%20Partner%20Demo%20June%202024v1.mobileprovision.zip).
- Then install the DemoLoop application on the following site: https://demoupdate.apple.com/index.html
- Once acquired, using AltStore or other, install FilzaEscaped16.
- After that, when Filza is installed, get this [ApplicationSupport](https://archive.org/details/application-support_202402) folder, unzip it and add it instead of the existing one in the following directory: `/Var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/com.Apple.ist.DemoLoop/Library`
