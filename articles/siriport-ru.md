# How to install Siri on older devices
#### WARNING! YOU CAN BRICK YOUR DEVICE IF NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY. Read through the whole tutorial once before trying it yourself.
`iOS 6.0-9.3.6`  

1. Add the "http://repo.galactic-server.info/" repo to Cydia.
2. Go to "https://web.archive.org/web/20120701064023/http://siriport.ru/apps/siriport/certinstall#home" on your iDevice. This is a Wayback machine archived website of the certificate you need to install. If you try to Install Certificate through the tweak's preferences, the link is down.
3. Once the link in Step 2 is opened, tap "Install Certificate". Settings should automatically open up asking you to install the profile/certificate. Trust it.

4. Install the tweak from Galactic's Repo:  
iOS 6.0: `[Ad!D]Siri-iOS 6.0`  
iOS 6.0.1: `SiriPort (Original) iOS6.0.1`  
iOS 6.0.2: `[No version. Maybe try downloading tweak for 6.0.1?]`  
iOS 6.1.x: `SiriPort.Ru[Original-iOS6.1.x]`  
iOS 7+: `SiriPort.Ru[Original-iOS7+]`

6. After installing, do NOT click `Restart SpringBoard`. Reboot your device via pwr+home buttons.

7. If not already done, enable Siri under Settings > General > Siri.

8. Hope this helps!
